# Automated-Cardiac-Diagnosis-Challenge-ACDC-
Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) This project focuses on using deep learning to automate the diagnosis of cardiac conditions from MRI scans. We segment key cardiac structures (LV, RV, MYO) and predict heart conditions like cardiomyopathies and infarction. Built with Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV for image processing and classification.
